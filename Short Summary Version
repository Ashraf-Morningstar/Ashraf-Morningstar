Ashraf Siddiqui, known online as Morningstar, began his journey at the age of seven with a slow computer, broken Windows, and an endless curiosity for technology. Over 15 years, he explored programming, design, and online communities, learning more than 16 programming languages, building tools, apps, bots, and creative projects.

From early experiments in Java, Python, and graphics, to creating video downloaders, UI design tools, automation scripts, extensions, and AI-driven concepts, Ashraf grew through constant trial and error. He collaborated with friends, joined online teams, freelanced internationally, and contributed silently to various communities under multiple usernames.

His path was not easy—health struggles, family responsibilities, burnout, account deletions, financial pressure, and personal challenges forced him to restart many times. But every restart made him stronger.

Ashraf later shifted toward UI/UX and graphic design, teaching, freelancing, and helping others with projects while maintaining a calm, private life. Despite being underestimated, he continued to create with kindness and passion.

In 2025, Ashraf returned to the first private GitHub account he made as a child. He made it public as his final repository, preserving his entire journey—his work, his growth, his failures, his evolution.

“The Last Repository” stands not as a project,
but as a lifetime of learning, resilience, and creativity.

A final message from Ashraf:
“Hello everyone, and goodbye.”
