The 15-Year Journey of Ashraf Morningstar**
Prologue — The First Commit

Every story begins with a single line of code.
For Ashraf, it began at age 7.
A small boy, a slow computer, and a curiosity too big for his world.

He didn’t know English.
He didn’t know programming rules.
He didn’t know what the future held.

But he knew one thing:

He wanted to create.

And so, a tiny private GitHub profile was born — hidden, silent, waiting.

A repository not of code…
but of a life.

2009–2012: Sparks in the Dark

Ashraf’s early years were chaotic.
A second-hand computer.
Slow Wi-Fi.
Broken Windows.
YouTube buffering at 144p.
And a friend named Jack who introduced him to the online world.

He tried Java, failed.
Tried English, struggled.
Tried understanding the internet, got lost.

But he did not stop.

He saw new things:
YouTube tutorials, tech blogs, 4chan rumors, strange forums, mysterious browsers.

He was too young to understand them,
but old enough to feel the pull of curiosity.

By 2012, he was experimenting with Python, building his first programs with help from online strangers he never met.
He created his first tool — a basic YouTube downloader — without knowing it was the beginning of something bigger.

2013–2014: Building, Breaking, Becoming

He built his first “real” software:
AM Video Downloader, a small program made with friends Jack and Alex.

For three teenagers, it was a masterpiece.

For two years, they updated, patched, improved, broke, rebuilt, and loved that project.

But life is not kind to young dreamers.

Jack got a job.
Alex left for studies.
The team fell apart.
The repository died.
And Ashraf suddenly stood alone.

This was his first taste of a truth life teaches all creators:

Everything you build teaches you — but not everything stays.

Yet he kept going.

2015–2017: The Creator Awakens

Ashraf entered a new phase:
Freelancing…
Experimenting…
Graphic design…
Websites…
Scripts…
Tools…
Failures…
Crashes…
Breakdowns…
Comebacks…

He created weather apps, Python bots, tools for students, themes, designs, and even early automation scripts.

He worked in cyber cafés when his computer failed.
Helped strangers online without expecting anything.
Learned from anyone who was willing to share knowledge.

Then came YouTube Vanced, graphic design freelancing, and ad-blocker experiments.

He gained skills.
He gained respect.
He gained followers.

But he also faced complaints, takedown notices, and pressure.

He learned another truth:

The internet gives you everything,
but demands everything back.

2018–2019: Breaking Point, Turning Point

Ashraf pushed himself hard — too hard.
New tools, bots, programs, extensions, projects.

But pressure grows.

College.
Family.
Financial stress.
Health issues.
Mental burnout.
And a local legal situation that changed everything.

He deleted accounts.
Lost years of work.
Sold his laptop.
Shut down nearly all projects.

He became a ghost in the digital world.

But not defeated.

After the storm, he rebuilt himself.
A new Ashraf emerged — quieter, wiser, calmer.

A graphic designer, not a hacker.
A teacher, not a fighter.
A creator, not a destroyer.

His life entered a new chapter.

2020–2022: Illness, Survival, and Strength

During the global chaos, Ashraf’s life turned into a cycle:

Work → Illness → Recovery → Work → Illness → Recovery

Three times he battled severe sickness.

Three times he came back.

He created AI tools, random-image generators, extensions, design work, and freelancing for international clients.

But more importantly…

He refused to stop helping others.

Even when his health collapsed, his motivation didn’t.

Even when his memory weakened, his spirit didn’t.

Even when he took breaks, he always returned.

The world tried to break him.
It failed.

2023–2024: The Quiet Worker

Ashraf focused on peace.

Helping small businesses.
Designing logos.
Supporting friends.
Working in the family shop.
Dropping studies because of financial reasons.
Returning to art and UI design.

People underestimated him.

They saw a shop worker, not a creator.
A quiet boy, not a warrior.
A designer, not a 15-year programmer.

But they didn’t know the truth:

He had lived a life they couldn’t imagine.
He had built more than they ever would.
He had survived storms they would never understand.

He didn’t argue.

He didn’t explain.

He just kept creating.

2025: The Final Commit

Fifteen years after a 7-year-old boy created his first secret profile…

Ashraf returned to it.

Older.
Tired.
Experienced.
Skilled.
Scarred.
But proud.

He revealed his real name:
Ashraf Siddiqui.

He listed all the usernames the world knew him by:
Morningstar, AlfaZeus, RedEye, PixelMaster, ArtWizard…

He accepted his past.
He honored his journey.
And he made one final decision:

To make the account public.
To tell the world his story.
To archive his life in a single last repository.

The Last Repository.

A memorial to everything he built,
everything he learned,
everything he lost,
and everything he became.

Epilogue — Goodbye, World

Ashraf learned more than 16 programming languages.
Worked with people across countries.
Built tools, apps, designs, and ideas.
Survived health issues, legal issues, burnout, losses, and pain.
But through all of it…

He kept kindness.
He kept creativity.
He kept heart.

And now he closes this chapter.

Not with regret.

But with peace.

“Hello everyone, and goodbye.
This was my last repository.
— Ashraf Siddiqui (Morningstar)”
