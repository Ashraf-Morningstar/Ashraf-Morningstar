* ABAP - Generated Code Example
* Automatically generated meaningful code structure

* Variable Declarations
DATA var_0 = 0;
DATA var_1 = 10;
DATA var_2 = 20;
DATA var_3 = 30;
DATA var_4 = 40;
DATA var_5 = 50;
DATA var_6 = 60;
DATA var_7 = 70;
DATA var_8 = 80;
DATA var_9 = 90;

* Control Flow Logic
* Simulating a loop structure
WRITE "Operation 0 executed"
WRITE "Operation 1 executed"
WRITE "Operation 2 executed"
WRITE "Operation 3 executed"
WRITE "Operation 4 executed"
WRITE "Operation 5 executed"
WRITE "Operation 6 executed"
WRITE "Operation 7 executed"
WRITE "Operation 8 executed"
WRITE "Operation 9 executed"
WRITE "Operation 10 executed"
WRITE "Operation 11 executed"
WRITE "Operation 12 executed"
WRITE "Operation 13 executed"
WRITE "Operation 14 executed"
WRITE "Operation 15 executed"
WRITE "Operation 16 executed"
WRITE "Operation 17 executed"
WRITE "Operation 18 executed"
WRITE "Operation 19 executed"

* Mathematical Calculations
* Calculation 0
result_0 = var_0 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_0
* Calculation 1
result_1 = var_1 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_1
* Calculation 2
result_2 = var_2 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_2
* Calculation 3
result_3 = var_3 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_3
* Calculation 4
result_4 = var_4 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_4
* Calculation 5
result_5 = var_5 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_5
* Calculation 6
result_6 = var_6 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_6
* Calculation 7
result_7 = var_7 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_7
* Calculation 8
result_8 = var_8 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_8
* Calculation 9
result_9 = var_9 * 2 + 5
WRITE result_9
