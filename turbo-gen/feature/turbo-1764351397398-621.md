# Refactor: Update tsconfig for Stricter Type Checks

This PR refactors the project's `tsconfig.json` to enable `strictNullChecks` and `noImplicitAny`. These changes will enforce stricter type checking across the codebase, reducing potential runtime errors and improving code quality. Several files were updated to satisfy the new type constraints.
